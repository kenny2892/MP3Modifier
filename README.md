# MP3Modifier
![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenny2892/MP3Modifier/master/MP3%20Modifier%202.0/src/Resources/Images/Icon.png)

This is my MP3 Modification program that I created to perform various tasks with my music library.

It contains:
- A Music Player
  - With cover art, volume controls, playlist functionality, and displayable information.
- A Modification Center
  - Can add title, artist, album, genre, lyrics, comments, and cover art.
- A Name Changer
  - Will change the file name based off of the mp3's tags.
- A Title Creator
  - Will add a title tag to the file based off of the file's name.

I used [JAudioTagger](http://www.jthink.net/jaudiotagger/index.jsp) to allow for tag editing and [JACo MP3 Player](http://jacomp3player.sourceforge.net/download.html) to allow for the playing of MP3 files.
Specifically:
- [JAudioTagger: 2.2.6 Snapshot](https://bitbucket.org/ijabz/jaudiotagger/downloads/)
- [JACo MP3 Player: Unlisted Version](https://sourceforge.net/p/jacomp3player/code/HEAD/tree/JACo%20MP3%20Player%20Resources/)
