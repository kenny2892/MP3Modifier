This is my MP3 Modification program. that I created to perform various tasks with my music library.

It contains:
- A Music Player
  - With cover art, volume controls, playlist functionality, and displayable information.
- A Modification Center
  - Can add title, artist, album, genre, lyrics, comments, and cover art.
- A Name Changer
  - Will change the file name based off of the mp3's tags.
- A Title Creator
  - Will add a title tag to the file based off of the file's name.
